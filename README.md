- calculate cosine similarities between movies
- train a NMF model
- write a Flask web interface for the recommender

### How to launch the recommender:
- clone repository
- run the file application.py
  - from command line: navigate to the location of application.py (folder name flask_app) and run the command '''python application.py'''
  - or open application.py in IDE of your choice and rung it from there
- when you see the message '''* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/''' open mentioned url (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in browser of your choice
